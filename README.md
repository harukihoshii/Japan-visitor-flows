## Chord diagram
I used pyCirclize to plot the inter-relationships between prefectures using the same dataset. The below image shows a chord diagram for visitor flow movement in 2019.

There are strong dependent relationships between Tokyo and the prefectures in the Kansai region, which is one of the most notable trends. Additionally, it highlights local relationships among Kansai prefectures, including Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, and Hyogo confirming how visitors try to maximise their trip among prefectures in close proximity.
